    title: "Guitar Hero on FPGA and ESP32",
    narrative:
      "I recreated Guitar Hero using an FPGA and an ESP32! My CMOD F7 FPGA is hooked up to a 4 LED strip display. Using SystemVerilog I programmed the outputs of the FGPA to control the notes going down the LED strips. At first I just used the buttons on the FPGA to play but I eventually upgraded to a wireless controller! I designed and soldered a custom FPGA to hold my ESP32. I wrote firmware to utilize it's wireless communication power, then hooked the FPGA up to another ESP32 (to receieve the bluetooth signals and transfer them to the FPGA). I wish I took a better video of this project before I took it down... as with all my other projects.",

    title: "Rocket Control Systems",
    narrative:
      "I built a real-time avionics system for a model rocket using an ESP32 running an RTOS. I designed a PCB in KiCad and then soldered everything together. The rocket communicated with a ground station over the 2.4GHz band through an antenna module. I hooked up an MPU-6050 accelerometer and gyroscope to track the rocketâ€™s motion in real time, then wrote C++ firmware to handle the high-speed physics calculations for its guidance system. On the ground, I used Python and Matplotlib to visualize all the flight data.",

    title: "Traffic Signal Simulation System",
    narrative:
      "I built a full traffic intersection simulator in C++ and OpenGL. I drew an intersection with shaders in OpenGL and programmed cars to drive through it with realistic physics in C++. I programmed multiple traffic light control algorithms in order to find the the most efficient one. The system tracks every car's wait time, and the total intersection throughput, and some of the smarter control modes cut total delay by nearly 45% compared to the basic fixed timer. I did this project because I think that a lot of intersections in the US suck and need to be upgraded with smarter software to reduce traffic.",
